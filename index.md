      <h3>Predictive Analytics and Explainable AI</h3>
      <p>In this project, I developed an AI model to identify and quantify the key factors contributing to customer churn in a subscription-based service. The model not only predicts churn with usable accuracy and precision, but also provides insightful interpretations of the underlying causes. The results shown were implemented recently in a subscription-based business and reduced churn by > 15%.</p>

      <h3>Conversation Modeling</h3>
      <p>This project aims is part of a large effort to leverage Generative AI to create a "virtual mechanic." Here, LDA is used to find unique topics for proper summarization, clustering and enoding.</p>

      <h3>Large Language Models with RAG</h3>
      <p>This project aims to leverage Generative AI to create a "virtual mechanic." By utilizing a corpus of text gathered from a car forum, this AI-driven tool will be capable of understanding unstructured questions and providing relevant answers. </p>

      <h3>Statistical Analysis of Homelessness</h3>
      <p>Homelessness represents a persistent and growing challenge in the United States  with the magnitude of homelessness particularly evident in Los Angeles, California .  This study was undertaken to look for possible answers that may ultimately help this underserved community.</p>
