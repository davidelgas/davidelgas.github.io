      <h3>Predictive Analytics and Explainable AI</h3>
      <p>In this project, I developed an AI model to identify and quantify the key factors contributing to customer churn in a subscription-based service. The model not only predicts churn with usable accuracy and precision, but also provides insightful interpretations of the underlying causes. The results shown were implemented recently in a subscription-based business and reduced churn by > 15%.</p>
